## ARDUINO LEONARDO HID PAYLOAD v1.0 
 
Human Interface Device Payload that allows your Arduino Leonardo board to execute commands with elevated privileges. Methods of activating and obfuscating the command prompt interface while code is being executed is listed in comments within the code. Feel free to modify the delay times for your own calibration. An optional LED switch is also hard coded (uses pins 7 & 8) for payload execution completion. Future versions will use an LCD interface mounted to the Leonardo itself.
